# Intro

[Jungle Board Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_(board_game)) (Chinese: dou shou qi (simplified Chinese: 斗兽棋; traditional Chinese: 鬥獸棋; pinyin: dòu shòu qí; lit.) is a chinese board game played by two aponents.
The game rules are fairly simple.  Each player has eight pieces in shape of different animals (rat through elephant) which are ranked from smallest to largest.

  The objective is either:

  * Capture all aponents' pieces,
  * Land one of the owns' pieces on the aponents den-square.

The detailed rule description can be found [Rules.md](here).

This project aims at implementing this game using bitboards and smart NPC.
